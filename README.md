### This repository contains our Final project in Java Course During iTi Ai pro Track as we created Exploratory Data analysis on wuzzuf Dataset using Spark core and spark SQL then deployed our job in Spring boot web service ,making some visualization Using Xchart and display All outputs in the webservice 

# Project Functionality:

1- Read dataset From csv and convert it to spark Dataframe.

2- Display structure and summary os data on console and using webservice.

10- print each skill and the frequency of it to get the most common skills .

11- factorize the YearsEXP column to numbers the add the new column to the dataset
